# Expense Calculator
## Adds expenses from csv or html and organizes it by category

This is/was a personal project I started after I needed to figure out how much money was spent on what over a year from only bank statements. I used it for 2 years rather successfully. Creating the categories is manual.

For example: you can download a csv off all your bank transactions online (I've know Chase and BMO Harris can do this) set it as your input in the code, and you can either print or write a file of all the time you bought grocheries or gas.
Note: the first time you do this you'll have too many enteries because there are no or the wrong categories. Update the categories, run the program again, and iterativly your data will get more and more organized. 

**Warning: this is a > PERSONAL project. It was not made for others. I will probably be very useless to anyone who stumbles accross this.**

P.S.  Yes, I wrote this in Python the first year and the Java the next just for fun.
